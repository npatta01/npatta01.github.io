I am data engineer at a media startup in NY.
Previously I was a software engineer at Comcast and a Masters student in Computer Science from RIT.

Learning is my goal. There are so many things I am excited to learn and share my trials and triumps.

If there is something you feel that I know and would love to discus with me.

I am Machine Learning Engineer interested in Deep Learning.

Currently I am working at a health care startup in NY.


Previously I was a software engineer at Comcast and a Masters student in Computer Science from RIT.

Learning is my goal. There are so many things I am excited to learn and share my trials and triumps.

If there is something you feel that I know and would love to discus with me, please reach out.

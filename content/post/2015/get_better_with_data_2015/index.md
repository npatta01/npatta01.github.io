On November 7-8, there was a hackathon in NY focused on analyzing the health care data.

Data
----

Our team was assigned to look at the relationship of physicians/hosiptial with companies.

The Affordable Care Act requires Center of Medicare/Medicaid services to collect information from applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in order to report information about their financial relationships with physicians and hospitals.

The relationships between doctors and hospitals having financial relationships could impact the deliverability of care.


Analysis
-------
For the purpose of the hackathon, we were interested in getting some high level overview of the data.

In the interest of time, we focused on the top 4 physician specialities (Orthopaedic Surgery,  Internal Medicine,Cardiovascular Disease,  Neurological Surgery)

Here are more of the visualizations we created.

Here is a plot showing the distribution of payments across specialities.

Hackathon Feedback
-------
This is actually my third hackathon. In general I am not a fan of hackathons. Simple issues like struggling with an idea, package issues and understanding the data have hindered my enjoyment of the event.

With that said, this hackathon was awesome and very well organized. The participants were broken into teams that worked on different data sets. The teams focused on different tracks (cleanig the data, descriptive analysis, modelling). Members were assigned to teams such that the team was composed of people who were good at the task or had a strong interest in improving those skills.

During the hackathon they had interesting speakers from health care companies in the NY area such as Flatiron, Komodo Health, Mount Sinai hospital.
Also, during the hackathon we had a team leader who came and frequently checked the progress of our work.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience.

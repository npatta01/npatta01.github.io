The syllabus of the program can be found [here](http://www.thisismetis.com/data-science).

There are similar such programs.

Here is a review of other programs [link1](http://www.skilledup.com/articles/list-data-science-bootcamps) and [link2](http://yet-another-data-blog.blogspot.com/2014/04/data-science-bootcamp-landscape-full.html)

Look forwarding to share my experience.
